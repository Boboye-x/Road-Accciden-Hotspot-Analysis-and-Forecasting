This study comprises a comprehensive analysis of road traffic accident data using big data 
and data mining techniques to uncover underlying patterns, predict accident occurrences, and 
inform safety strategies in Kingston Upon Hull and surrounding areas. Extracting data from 
SQLite relational database, this report explores exploratory data analysis, association rule 
mining, cluster analysis, spatiotemporal analysis, social network analysis, and time series 
forecasting. Results revealed that accidents occur more frequently during peak hours on 
weekdays, particularly involving motorcyclists and pedestrians. The Apriori algorithm 
showed that drivers are the most frequently involved in slight accidents. Clustering 
techniques identified regional hotspots, while social network analysis exposed key structural 
influencers in communication patterns. Time series models, including SARIMA, ARIMA, 
and XGBoost, were applied to forecast accidents, with XGBoost outperforming statistical 
models across all selected regions. Based on the findings, the report recommends dynamic 
traffic control systems, targeted pedestrian awareness campaigns, and stricter vehicle 
licensing procedures.
